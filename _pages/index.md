# Welcome to my digital garden! 🌱
## Come inside and pull up a chair... 🏡🪑☕️

<p class="key-idea">
  Hey, I'm Carlton! 👋🏾 My oldest and closest friends just call me "C" or "Big C". At the time of writing, I'm 192cm tall (or 6' 3.5", for those in Imperial-land), so I guess it's kinda clever as a nickname. 🤪

  Anyhow, you have happened upon a collection of my various thoughts and ideas. Whilst I say <em>my</em> ideas, I realise that's not always strictly true. Like most creativity, these concepts are mostly borrowed, built upon or broken apart into pieces; pieces that might be put back together in novel or insightful ways. 🤹🏾
