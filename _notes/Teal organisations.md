See the work of Frederic Laloux in *Reinventing Organizations (2014)*.

According to Laloux, the evolution of humanity passes through various leaps or steps, which represent five different stages of human consciousness. This are described with colours as below:

| Colour | Style        | Characteristics |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Red    | Impulsive    | Establishing and enforcing authority through power.|
| Amber  | Conformist   | Moral view internalized according to common group beliefs.|
| Orange | Achievement  | The world is predictable, scientifically observable and controllable.|
| Green  | Pluralistic  | A sense of inclusion and a drive to view and treat all people as equal.|
| Teal   | Evolutionary | The world is a place where everyone is called by intuition to contribute based on their unique potential. |

Since organisations are large groups of people, their structures can also be classified in the same way. Teal organisations are characterised by a high degree of autonomy and [[Psychological safety| psychological safety]]. The teams within them are usually[[High performance | high performing]] when the tasks involve a high degree of creativity and innovation, since innovation involves inherent risk of failure. These organisations do best not by trying to lower the *risk* of failure - which can never be zero - but by lowering the *cost* of failure.
