title: Product Ethics
---

When discovering potential solutions to a problem, product teams try to mitigate four key risks by ensuring that their solutions are:

1. Valuable
2. Usable
3. Feasible
4. Viable

A fifth risk is often overlooked: ensuring that the product is ethical. We can build something that delivers value to users, that they can understand, that engineers can build without disproportionate effort and that we can build a business around. But does that mean that we *should* build such a product? 

Perhaps [[co-creation]] of products with the intended users and customers can mitigate this final risk.
