In knowledge economies, we are paid to think. In the industrial economies that often precede them, we are paid _not_ to think e.g. the production line. The knowledge economy's outcomes are based on our ability to think, innovate, create and implement.

Some folks refer to five energy drivers:

1. [[Movement|Move]]
2. [[Nutrition|Eat]]
3. [[Sleep]]
4. [[Rest|Relax]]
5. [[Connection|Connect]]
