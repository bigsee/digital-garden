## Main responsibilities of a CTO

In one model, taken from CTO Craft main areas of proficiency of a CTO are:

- Technical Know-How
- Strategic Intelligence
- Team Building and Management
- Self-Examination
- Communication Skills
- Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving
- Leadership and Influence

<br><br>

Another model is _the four Ts_:

<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Team</td><td>Attract, motivate and inspire a great team</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Tools</td><td>Provide tools for the (whole) team to excel</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Tech</td><td>Understand (and be a student of) available technology as it evolves</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Timing</td><td>Guide leadership (and the team) on when we should work on what</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

    <tr>
        <td>CTO should contribute to the overall strategy definition</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Strategy requires an opportunity to reconfigure the value chain</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br><br><br>

<table style="background-color: #556b2f">
    <tr>
        <td>CTOs might be more strategic or focussed on operational efficiency</td>
    </tr>

    </tr>
</table>

## Types of CTO

A CTO might be focused on strategy through technical innovation or through operational efficiency.
This will depend on the context of the company or market opportunity. Another way to express this is 
whether the company is a technology company, or a company where technology plays a supporting role.
