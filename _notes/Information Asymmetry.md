title: Information Asymmetry
---

Power concentrates around different commodities depending on the type of economy. In the agricultural and industrial economies, power is positively correlated with physical capabilities: the strong and the mighty, individually and collectively, directly or practically, are the rulers. In a knowledge economy, power is instead correlated with access to information.

Poor distribution of information - or *information asymmetry* - results in inefficient markets, chiefly due to inaccurate sub-optimal pricing in transactions. This was observed by Joseph Stiglitz and others in their 2001 Nobel Prize-winning work. The same framework might also be useful to think about the distribution of information in an organisational structure.

[[Teal organisational structures |]][[Teal organisations | Teal organisational structures]] solve for this through transparency, a flat hierarchy and removal of impediments to communication across teams or business areas.
