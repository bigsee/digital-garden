I often see differing models around to explain the emotional and psychological space ones needs to be in to grow. I prefer the model of three concentric circles, where the innermost represents comfort and the outermost represents panic:

The key to effective growth is to be exposed to just enough pressure/information to get out of one's comfort zone but not so much that one becomes overwhelmed.
