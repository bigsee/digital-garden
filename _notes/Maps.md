The value of a map is in its ability to describe a terrain. Describing terrain is assumed to 
be a precursor to navigating it, which allows movement (known in some contexts as [Travel](/travel)). According to Simon Wardley, maps different from graphs through three important features:

1. An anchor e.g. magnetic North
2. The relative positioning of elements
3. Consistency of movement
