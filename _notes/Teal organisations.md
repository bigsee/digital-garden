According to Laloux, the evolution of humanity passes through various leaps or steps, which represent five different stages of human consciousness. This are described with colours as below:

Since organisations are large groups of people, their structures can also be classified in the same way. Teal organisations are characterised by a high degree of autonomy and [[Psychological safety| psychological safety]]. The teams within them are usually[[High performance | high performing]] when the tasks involve a high degree of creativity and innovation, since innovation involves inherent risk of failure. These organisations do best not by trying to lower the *risk* of failure - which can never be zero - but by lowering the *cost* of failure.
