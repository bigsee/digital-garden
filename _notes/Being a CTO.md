In one model, taken from CTO Craft main areas of proficiency of a CTO are:

- Technical Know-How
- Strategic Intelligence
- Team Building and Management

Another model is _the four Ts_:

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Team</td><td>Attract, motivate and inspire a great team</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Tools</td><td>Provide tools for the (whole) team to excel</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Tech</td><td>Understand (and be a student of) available technology as it evolves</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Timing</td><td>Guide leadership (and the team) on when we should work on what</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
