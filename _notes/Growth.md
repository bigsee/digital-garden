I often see differing models around to explain the emotional and psychological space ones needs to be in to grow. I prefer the model of three concentric circles, where the innermost represents comfort and the outermost represents panic.

The key to effective grow is to be exposed to just enough pressure/information to get out of one's comfort zone but not so much that one becomes overwhelmed:
